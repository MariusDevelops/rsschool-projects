## Summary

My ultimate goal is to become professional full-stack developer who focus more on front-end side.

Why?

I like chellange, get visual results, build stuff and figure out how things are made behind a scene.

Front-end developement is a middle ground between ux/ui design and back-end. From this place I can reach both sides and learn everything what it takes to build full-stack applications. I like to know everything and there is so mutch to explore. More I learn, more passionate I get.

Nowdays I spent all my time learning to code. I think of my self as a self-organised, long time learner who can get things done and provide expected results.

## Skills

HTML, CSS, SCSS.

JavaScript, React.

Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator.

## Code Example

How to create method that fetches data from API in React:

```JS
 fetchAdvice = () => {
    axios
      .get("https://api.adviceslip.com/advice")
      .then((response) => {
        const { advice } = response.data.slip;
        this.setState({ advice });
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error);
      });
  };
  }
```

## Experience

- Portfolio - [Marius Bražas](https://mariusdevelops.github.io/)

I practise my coding skills by building [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/mariusdevelops), [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/MariusDevelops) and [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/users/MariusDevelops) challenges.

## Education

Master of Fine Arts. 2017.

## English

I think of my English as B2 level, however at last English language test I got B1.

Every day I write and read in English. My weak point is grammar. I will improve it before taking next language evaluation test.

Moreover, I lived in couple different countries where I had time to practise my English skills: England, Netherlands, Denmark, Czech Republic, Turkey, Germany.
